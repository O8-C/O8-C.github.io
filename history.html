        <h1>The Delicious History of Lasagna: From Ancient Roots to Modern Favorite</h1>
    </header>

	<h2>Ancient Origins</h2>

    <p>The concept of layered dough and fillings goes back to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. In fact, the word "lasagna" is derived from the Greek word "Laganon", which referred to a flat, sheet-like dough. This dough was cut into strips and used in a dish with various fillings, somewhat similar to the modern lasagna. The Romans also made a dish with layers of pasta, and in some regions, they would bake it with ingredients such as meat, vegetables, and sauces.</p>

    <h2>Medieval and Renaissance Period</h2>

    <p>During the Middle Ages, lasagna-like dishes began to evolve in Italy. The Lombards, who invaded Italy in the 6th century, brought with them a love for pasta dishes. By the 13th century, Italian cooks were experimenting with making pasta sheets that could be layered, creating early forms of lasagna. In some Italian regions, particularly in Naples, it became a common dish for special occasions.
    The Renaissance period saw more refined versions of lasagna, incorporating a variety of meats, cheese, and vegetables, often accompanied by a rich, creamy sauce. This early version would be closer to what we think of as lasagna today, though still not quite the modern version we are familiar with.</p>

    <h2>Modern Lasagna: Birth in Italy</h2>
    
    <p>The lasagna that we know today, with layers of pasta, cheese, meat, and tomato sauce, began to take shape in the 18th century in Naples. It was during this time that the concept of a tomato-based sauce began to play a significant role in Italian cooking, and it eventually became a hallmark of lasagna recipes. Béchamel sauce (a creamy white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk) also became a common addition.
    The tomato, introduced to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, became a fundamental ingredient in Italian cuisine. By the 19th century, when tomatoes were being widely used in sauces, the lasagna we recognize today began to emerge—especially in the south of Italy. Lasagna alla Bolognese, made with a rich meat sauce (ragù) and béchamel, became popular in the northern regions, especially in Bologna.</p>

    <h2>Lasagna in the Modern World</h2>

    <p>As Italian immigrants moved around the world, they brought their culinary traditions with them. Lasagna became a popular dish in the United States, particularly in the early 20th century. American cooks, influenced by the traditional Italian recipes, made adjustments—most notably by using mozzarella and ricotta cheese and often layering the dish with meat sauce and a variety of cheeses.
    In the United States, lasagna became a comfort food staple, served in family gatherings, holiday meals, and potlucks. Over time, it has also evolved into many regional varieties, from vegetarian lasagna to versions with seafood, turkey, or even plant-based alternatives.</p>
